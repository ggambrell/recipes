Serves:  ~ 16 cakes depending on size

Ingedients:  
2 tablespoons canola oil
1 cups chopped onions
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
2 1/2 cups cold cooked mashed potatoes
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 cup (about 2 1/8 oz.) + 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 ounces Gruyère cheese, shredded (about 3/4 cup)
2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, plus more for garnish
5 to 6 tablespoons olive oil, for frying
1/2 cup crème fraîche or sour cream

Directions:  
1. Heat canola oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. 
2. Add chopped onions, salt, and pepper; cook, stirring often, until onions are tender. 
3. Remove skillet from heat; transfer leeks to a large bowl, and let cool. **Do not wipe skillet clean.**

4. Add mashed potatoes, beaten eggs, flour, cheese, and parsley to bowl with onion, and gently fold together until well blended. 
5. Return skillet to medium-high, and heat 2 tablespoon olive oil. 
6. Drop 3 to 4 (1/4-cupfuls) of potato mixture into hot oil in skillet, and, using a fork, gently flatten into 3-inch pancakes. 
7. Cook pancakes until golden brown and lightly crisp, 2 to 3 minutes per side, adjusting the heat to medium if needed to keep from over browning. 
8. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels. 
9. Repeat with remaining potato mixture and, adding as needed, olive oil. 

Note:
1. Added flair: Serve topped with crème fraîche or sour cream. Garnish with parsley.

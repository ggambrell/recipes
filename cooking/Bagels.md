Acitve - 2hr :: Total - 3hr
Serves:  8 bagels

Ingedients:  
__Bagel__
1 and 1/2 cups warm water (100-110°F)
2 and 3/4 teaspoons instant or active dry yeast
4 cups bread flour (spoon & leveled), *plus some for work surface and hands*
1 Tablespoon granulated sugar or packed dark brown sugar (or barley malt syrup)*
2 teaspoons salt
Nonstick spray

__Egg wash__
1 egg white beaten with 1 Tablespoon water

__Hot Wash_
2 quarts water
1/4 cup (60g) honey (or barley malt syrup) OR
1 tablespoon baking soda

Directions:
Dough:
1. Whisk the warm water and yeast together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. 
2. Cover and allow to sit for 5 minutes.
3. Add the flour, brown sugar, and salt. 
4. Beat on low speed for 2 minutes. The dough is very stiff and will look somewhat dry.
5. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. 
6. With lightly floured hands, knead the dough for 4-5 minutes. The dough is too heavy for the mixer to knead it!
6b. (optional) divide dough and color, flavorings, or fillings (e.g. cinnimon, or cheddar jalapno)
7. Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick spray. 
8. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. 
9. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel.  
10. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 60-90 minutes or until double in size.
11. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper.
12. When the dough is ready (poke with two fingers and the indentaton remains), punch it down to release any air bubbles. 
13. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces.
14. Shape each piece into a ball. Press your index finger through the center of each ball to make a hole about 1.5 – 2 inches in diameter. 
15. Loosely cover the shaped bagels with kitchen towel and rest for a few minutes as you prepare the water bath.
16. Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C).

Water bath and Cooking:
17. Fill a large, wide pot with 2 quarts of water. 
18.Whisk in the honey. (Or add baking soda)
19. Bring water to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-high. 
20. Drop bagels in making sure they have enough room to float around. Cook the bagels for 30 seconds on each side.
21. Using a pastry brush, brush the egg wash on top and around the sides of each bagel. 
22. Place 4 bagels onto each lined baking sheet. 
23. Bake for 20-25 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. You want the bagels to be a dark golden brown. 
24. Remove from the oven and allow bagels to cool.

Notes:
1. Divide dough and color before rising to make rainbow bagels.
2. Overnight Make Ahead Instructions: Allow the dough to rise overnight in the refrigerator. The slow rise gives the bagels wonderful flavor! In the morning, remove the dough from the refrigerator and let the dough rise for 45 minutes at room temperature. 
3. Bagels can be frozen and keep for a couple months.
4. Special Tools: stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment, large baking sheets, big pot (I use my 5.5 quart dutch oven), pastry brush.
5. Yeast: Use instant or active dry yeast. If using active dry yeast, the rise time may be up to 2 hours. 1 standard packet is about 2 and 1/4 teaspoons, so you will need a little more than 1 packet of yeast.
6. Bread Flour: Bagels require a high protein flour. Bread flour is a must. 
7. By Hand: If you do not have a mixer, you can mix the dough together in a large bowl then knead by hand for 10-15 minutes.
8. Bagel Varieties: toppings are added after the egg wash in step 9. 
9. Halve or Double: You can halve this dough recipe by simply halving all of the dough ingredients (do not halve the water or honey for the boiling step). No changes to the recipe instructions. For best taste and texture and to not overwhelm your mixer with excess heavy dough, I do not recommend doubling this dough recipe. Instead, make separate batches of dough.

9. Gently simmer, stirring, until slightly thickened and pale golden brown (5-7 minutes)  
10. Remove from the heat and whisk in the vanilla and salt.  
11. Immediately spread the mixture over the crust.  
12. Refrigerate until set (30-45 minutes)  
13. Place the chocolate and the remaining tablespoon butter in a microwave-safe bowl; cook on high until beginning to melt

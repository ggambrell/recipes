6. In a medium bowl whisk together buttermilk, egg, oil, honey, and vanilla until smooth.
7. Add wet ingredients into flour mixture and stir until combined and smooth.
8. Place 2 tablespoons of batter into each lined muffin tins. 
9. Spoon a heaping tablespoon of marshmallow creme on top of batter. 
10. Then spoon remaining batter evenly on top of muffins.  
11. Sprinkle streusel evenly on top of batter.  
12. Bake for 15-17 minutes, until tops are golden and set.  
13. When muffins come out of oven, immediately press milk chocolate evenly into tops.  
14. Allow muffins to cool in tin for 5 minutes and then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.  
15. Store at room temperature for up to 3 days.  

Notes:  
1. *Spoon & Sweep method: Use a spoon to fill measuring cup with flour until required amount is obtained. Scooping measuring cup directly into flour bag will firmly pack flour resulting in too much flour required for recipe.
2. Instead of pushing in chocolate chips, drizzle melted chocolate on top.

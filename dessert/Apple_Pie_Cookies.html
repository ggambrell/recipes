          <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>  
          <li>1 teaspoon salt</li> 
          <li>1/2 cup whole milk</li>

          <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
          <li>4 teaspoons whole milk, more or less as needed</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Directions: </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Combine butter, shortening, and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat to combine.</li>
        <li> Add egg and vanilla and mix (~2 min)</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add half of the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients with 1/4 cup of milk.</li>
        <li>Mix until combined.</li>
        <li>Add remaining dry ingredients and milk, and beat until mixed.</li>
        <li>Scrape down sides of bowl ensuring that ingredients are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Wrap dough in plastic wrap and chill for 30 minutes.</li>
          
        <li>Empty pie filling onto a cutting board, and use a large knife to chop the apple pieces until they are small chunks.</li>
        <li>Transfer filling to a bowl; set aside</li>
          
        <li>Preheat oven to 375Â°F.</li>
        <li>On a well floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/8-inch thickness. (Note: the dough will be very soft and sticky, so be sure to generously and regularly flour the surface under the dough if it begins to stick.)</li>
        <li>Using a 3-inch round cutter, cut out 14 circles.</li>
        <li>On a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, place 7 of the circles.</li>
        <li>Scoop 1 tablespoon of the apple pie filling into the center of each circle on the baking sheet, leaving a 1/4-inch ring around the circle with no apple filling</li>
        <li>Lift the other circles from the work surface and place them directly on top of the circles with the apple filling.</li>
        <li>Gently press the sides together and use a fork to crimp around the edges.</li>
        <li>Reroll the remaining dough and repeat process of cutting, filling, stacking, and sealing cookie rounds. </li>
        <li>Transfer baking sheet with cookies to refrigerator for 15 minutes.</li>
          
        <li>Bake until just beginning to brown and dough has cooked through (12 to 14 minutes)</li>
        <li>Cool completely before icing.</li>
          
        <li>Combine powdered sugar, cinnamon, and milk in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Stir, adding more milk if necessary until the icing is thick but easily spreadable.</li>
        <li>Spread a spoonful of the frosting on each of the cookies.</li>
      </ol>
    
      <h3>Notes: </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Thicker icing in step 23 will allow for more intricate/tasteful designs hen decorating.</li>
        <li>There will be extra pie filling left over. Can make a second batch of dough or use it for something else.</li>
      </ul>

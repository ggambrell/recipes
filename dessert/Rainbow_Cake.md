__Cake__  
24 oz (680 g) cake flour  
24 oz (680 g) granulated sugar  
1 tsp (1 tsp) salt  
2 Tbsp (2 Tbsp) baking powder  
1 tsp (1 tsp) baking soda  
10 oz (283 g) egg whites room temperature  
6 oz (170 g) vegetable oil  
18 oz (510 g) buttermilk room temperature or slightly warm  
12 oz (340 g) butter unsalted and softened  
1 Tablespoon (1 Tablespoon) vanilla extract  

__Buttercream Frosting__
8 oz (227 g) pasteurized egg whites  
32 oz (907 g) powdered sugar  
32 oz (907 g) unsalted butter softened but not melted  
2 tsp vanilla extract  
1/2 tsp (1/2 tsp) salt  
1 dot (1 dot) purple food coloring to make the buttercream white  

__White Chocolate Icing Drip__  
1/3 cup heavy cream (77 grams)
1 cup white chocolate chips (175 grams)  
Gel food coloring

__SEMI-SWEET CHOCOLATE (ALTERNATIVE)__
6 oz (1 cup | 169g) semi sweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream


Directions:  
1. Allow all the room temperature ingredients listed above to come to room temperature and be measured by weight so that the ingredients mix and incorporate correctly.
2. Heat oven to 335
3. Prepare six (8"x2") cake pans with a round piece of parchment paper in the bottom of the pan and greese the sides for easy removal of the cake
4. Combine 8 oz of the buttermilk and the oil together and set aside. 
5. Combine the remaining buttermilk, egg whites, and vanilla together, whisk to break up the eggs and set aside. 
6. Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment.   
7. Add your softened butter to the dry ingredients and mix on low until mixture resembles coarse sand (about 30 seconds).
8. Add in your milk/oil mixture and let mix until dry ingredients are moistened and then bump up to medium and let mix for 2 full minutes to develop the cake's structure. If you don't let your cake mix on this step your cake could collapse. 
9. Scrape your bowl and then reduce speed to low. 
10. Add in your egg white/milk mixture in three batches, letting the batter mix for 15 seconds between additions. 
11. Scrape down the sides again to make sure everything has incorporated.
12. Divide your batter into 6 bowls. Weigh 15 ounces of batter for each bowl.
13. Color each bowl with your food colors. 
14. Bake your layers for 20-24 minutes or until the edges start pulling away from the cake pan. Do not under-bake or the middle of the cake will collapse.
15. IMMEDIATELY TAP PAN FIRMLY on countertop once to release the steam from the cake. This stops the cake from shrinking. 
16. Let cakes cool for 10 minutes inside the pan before flipping them out.
17. Freeze your cake layers 30-60 minutes before trimming your cakes. 
18. Frost and fill with buttercream frosting.
19. After your buttercream is smooth, place the cake back into the fridge for 15 minutes before you apply your drip.
20. Wait for your drip to set before painting with gold paint. 
21. Finish the cake with buttercream rosettes and more sprinkles.
  
Easy Buttercream Instructions
1. Place powdered sugar and pasteurized egg whites in the bowl of your stand mixer with the whisk attachment.
2. Mix on low to combine then increase speed to high.
3. Add the butter in small chunks while mixing. Continue mixing until all the butter is added in. 
4. Add in your vanilla and salt.
5. Mix on high until light and fluffy and no longer tastes like butter. 
6. (Optional) Add a dot of purple food coloring to reduce the yellow appearance of the buttercream (optional)
7. Remove the whisk attachment and replace it with the paddle attachment. Mix on low for 10 minutes to remove bubbles from the buttercream.

Gold Drip Instructions
1. Heat heavy cream in a heatproof bowl in the microwave for 45 seconds, until it's just beginning to bubble. 
2. Gently pour white chocolate chips into the heavy cream, making sure they are fully covered with cream. Allow mixture to sit for 1 minute.
3. Stir slowly until the cream and white chocolate are combined. Some bits of chocolate may not be fully melted yet. Heat the mixture again for 20 seconds, and stir. Repeat as necessary until all the chocolate bits are fully melted and incorporated.
4. (Optional if white drip is desired) Add in the gel food coloring, if desired. Allow to cool until desired viscosity is reached (barely warm to the touch).
4b. If it seems too thin or thick, you can add a touch more chocolate chips or heavy cream! 

Notes:
1. Remove and change colors.
2. Try making a rainbow checkered cake.
3. **This is only enough drip to do the drip. It will not cover the entire top of the cake, so it will need to be decorated.**

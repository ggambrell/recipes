Serves:24 cookies  

Equipment:

Ingedients:  
4 cups Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal, divided  
1 cup butter, room temperature  
1 cup granulated sugar  
2 large eggs  
2 teaspoons vanilla extract  
1 teaspoon baking powder  
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt  
1 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
2 cups all purpose flour  
*optional: 1/2 cup white chocolate chips to melt for drizzle  

Directions:  
1. Preheat oven to 350°F. 
2. Line a baking sheet with parchment, set aside.  
3. Place 3 cups of Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal in a large zip-top bag and seal. 
4. Reserve the remaining 1 cup of cereal. 
5. Using a rolling pin, crush the cereal until it is a fine crumb. Alternately you can do this step in a food processor or blender. Set aside.  
6. In the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the butter and sugar together (2 minutes) 
7. Add in the eggs, vanilla, baking powder, salt and cinnamon, and continuing mixing until combined and smooth, scraping sides of the bowl as necessary.  
8. Turn the mixer to low and add in the flour until just combined. 
9. Mix in the crushed cereal until evenly incorporated. 
10. Stir in the reserved cup of uncrushed cereal.  
11. Using a medium (2- tablespoon) cookie scoop, portion out the dough and place 2- inches apart on the prepared baking sheet. 
12. Bake for 9 – 10 minutes until edges begin to golden.  
13. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.  
14. If desired melt white chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl in 20 second increments, stirring after each, until melted. 
15. Drizzle on top of the cookies.  

Notes:
1. To drizzle easily, put the melted chocolate in a small zip-top bag and snip off the corner.
2. You can omit adding in the extra 1 cup of Cinnamon Toast if you would prefer to not have that chewy texture.
3. Store airtight at room temperature for up to 3 days.

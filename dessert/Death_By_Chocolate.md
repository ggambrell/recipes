Instructions
Death By Chocolate Cake
NOTE: It is SUPER IMPORTANT that all the room temperature ingredients listed above are room temperature and not cold so that the ingredients mix and incorporate correctly. 
Heat oven to 335º F/168º C. Prepare cake pans with cake goop or another preferred pan release. I used three 8"x2" round cake pans. Use the cake batter calculator above this recipe card to adjust the recipe to your size cake pan. Optional: Line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper to prevent sticking from the chocolate chips.
In a large measuring cup combine the beer, espresso powder and vanilla. Whisk together and set aside. 
In a large bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, salt, baking powder and baking soda and set aside. 
Place the softened butter in the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment. Cream until smooth and shiny. With the mixer on low, gradually sprinkle in the sugar. Mix on medium high until mixture is fluffy and almost white. About 3-5 minutes. 
Reduce the speed back to low. Add your (ROOM TEMP) eggs one at a time. Let the egg incorporate fully before adding in the next egg to avoid breaking your batter. Add in your mayo and mix until combined. 
With the mixer on low, add in 1/3 of your dry ingredients and mix until almost combined. Add in 1/3 of your liquid ingredients. Repeat the process two more times until everything is combined. 
Fold in the mini chocolate chips and divide the cake batter into your cake pans. Bake for 40 - 45 minutes until a toothpick comes out cleanly but with a few sticky crumbs. Don't over bake. 
Let your cakes cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes before turning out onto a cooling rack. Let fully cool then gently wrap in plastic wrap and chill until the cakes are firm enough to handle. You can flash chill in the freezer if you need to cool them quickly. 


Mediavine
Easy Chocolate Buttercream
Sift together the powdered sugar and cocoa powder to remove any clumps.
Place pasteurized egg whites, powdered sugar and cocoa powder in the bowl of your stand mixer.
Attach the whisk, combine ingredients on low and then whip on high for 5 minutes.
Add in your softened butter in chunks. Add in vanilla and salt. Whisk on high until light and fluffy.
Optional: Switch to a paddle attachment and mix on low for 15-20 minutes to make the buttercream very smooth and remove air bubbles.
Ganache Drip
Microwave your chocolate for 30 seconds to get it warm
Heat cream on the stove over medium heat just until it starts to simmer. Do not boil. chilled cake. 
Pour over chocolate and let sit for 5 minutes. Whisk until smooth. If you have lumps, place the bowl into a microwave for 30 seconds and whisk. Let the ganache cool to about 90º (barely warm to the touch). Place the ganache into a piping bag and drizzle over the top of your frosted and chilled cake.

Notes
1. Bring all your ingredients to room temperature or even a little warm (eggs, beer, mayo, butter, etc) to ensure your batter does not break or curdle. 
2. Use a scale to weigh your ingredients (including liquids) unless otherwise instructed (Tablespoons, teaspoons, pinch etc). Metric measurements are available in the recipe card. Scaled ingredients are much more accurate than using cups and help ensure the success of your recipe. 
3. Practice Mise en Place (everything in it's place). Measure out your ingredients ahead of time and have them ready before you start mixing to reduce the chances of accidentally leaving something out.
4. Chill your cakes before frosting and filling. You can cover a frosted and chilled cake in fondant if you wish. This cake is also great for stacking. I always keep my cakes chilled in the refrigerator before delivery for easy transporting. Learn more about decorating your first cake. 
5. If the recipe calls for specific ingredients like cake flour, replacing it with all-purpose flour and cornstarch is not recommended unless specified in the recipe that it’s ok. Substituting ingredients may cause this recipe to fail. 
All purpose flour is a plain flour with no rising agents. It has a protein level of 10%-12%
Cake flour is a soft, low protein flour of 9% or less. Cake flour sources: UK - Shipton Mills Cake & Pastry Flour
6. I always keep my frosted cakes in the fridge. The frosting acts as a barrier and keeps the cake fresh but NEVER serve a cold cake. Cold cakes taste very dry because the butter is cold. Always take your cakes out of the fridge a few hours before you serve them. I've even gone as far as microwaving my cake slice for 10 seconds if it's too cold. 
7. You can replace the Guinness in this recipe with another type of stout beer or room temperature water or coffee, but it will not have the same taste. 
8. You can replace the mayo in this recipe with room temperature greek yogurt or sour cream, but it will not have the same taste.

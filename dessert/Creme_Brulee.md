Acitve - 20 min :: Total - 2hr + overnight
Serves: 8 

Ingedients:  
5 large egg yolks
3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar, divided
3 cups (720ml) heavy cream or heavy whipping cream*
1/2 teaspoon espresso powder (optional but recommended)*
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 and 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract*

Directions:  
Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C).
1. Whisk the egg yolks and 1/2 cup (100g) of granulated sugar together. Set aside. (At this point or before you temper the egg yolks in the next step) 
2. Bring a ot of water to a boil. (You’ll need hot water to pour into the baking sheet for the water bath.)
3. Heat the heavy cream, espresso powder (optional) , and salt together in a medium saucepan over medium heat. As soon as it begins to simmer, remove from heat. 
4. Stir in the vanilla extract. 
5. Add 1/2 cup of warm heavy cream and, in a slow and steady stream, whisk into the egg yolks. 
6. In a slow and steady stream, pour and whisk the egg yolk mixture into the warm heavy cream.
7. Place ramekins in a large baking pan. 
8. Divide custard between each, filling 4/5 to the top. 
9. Carefully fill the pan with about a 1/2 inch of the hot water. The baking pan will be hot so use an oven mitt to carefully transfer the pan to the oven.
10. Bake until the edges are set and centers are a little jiggly. (30 minutes depending on depth of ramekin, keep cooking until ready)
11. Remove pan from the oven and, using an oven mitt, remove the ramekins from the pan.
12. Place on a wire rack to cool for at least 1 hour. 
13. Place in the refrigerator, loosely covered, and chill over night.
14. Using the remaining granulated sugar, sprinkle a thin layer all over the surface of the chilled custards. 
15. Caramelize the sugar with a kitchen torch and serve immediately.


Note:
1. Try expresso and other flavors.

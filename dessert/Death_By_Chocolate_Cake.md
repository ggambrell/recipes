Directions:
Cake
1. Bring all ingredients to room temperature as noted above.
2. Heat oven to 335
3. Greese cake pan sides.Line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper to prevent sticking from the chocolate chips.
4. In a large measuring cup combine the beer, espresso powder and vanilla. Whisk together and set aside. 
5. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, salt, baking powder and baking soda and set aside. 
6. Place the softened butter in the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment. Cream until smooth and shiny. 
7. With the mixer on low, gradually sprinkle in the sugar. Mix on medium high until mixture is fluffy and almost white. About 3-5 minutes. 
8. Reduce the speed back to low. Add your (ROOM TEMP) eggs one at a time. Let the egg incorporate fully before adding in the next egg to avoid breaking your batter. 
9. Add in your mayo and mix until combined. 
10. With the mixer on low, add in 1/3 of your dry ingredients and mix until almost combined. 
11. Add in 1/3 of your liquid ingredients. 
12. Repeat the process two more times until everything is combined. 
13. Fold in the mini chocolate chips and divide the cake batter into your cake pans. 
14. Bake for 40 - 45 minutes until a toothpick comes out cleanly but with a few sticky crumbs.  
15. Let your cakes cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes before turning out onto a cooling rack. Let fully cool.
16. Chill until the cakes is ready for drip. You can flash chill in the freezer if you need to cool them quickly. This slows the drip.

Easy Chocolate Buttercream
17. Sift together the powdered sugar and cocoa powder to remove any clumps.
18. Place pasteurized egg whites, powdered sugar and cocoa powder in the bowl of your stand mixer.
19. Attach the whisk, combine ingredients on low and then whip on high for 5 minutes.
20. Add in your softened butter in chunks, one at a time. 
21. Add in vanilla and salt. Whisk on high until light and fluffy.
22. Switch to a paddle attachment and mix on low for 15-20 minutes to make the buttercream very smooth and remove air bubbles.
23. Ice the cake. Put back in fridge.

Ganache Drip
24. Microwave your chocolate for 30 seconds to get it warm
25. Heat cream on the stove over medium heat just until it starts to simmer. Do not boil. 
26. Pour over chocolate and let sit for 5 minutes. 
27. Whisk until smooth. If you have lumps, place the bowl into a microwave for 30 seconds and whisk. Let the ganache cool to about 90ยบ (barely warm to the touch). 
28. Place the ganache into a piping bag/bottle and drizzle over the top of your frosted and chilled cake.

Notes
1. Bring all your ingredients to room temperature to ensure your batter does not break or curdle. 
2. Use a scale to weigh your ingredients (including liquids) unless otherwise instructed (Tablespoons, teaspoons, pinch etc) to help ensure the success of your recipe. 
3. Measure out your ingredients ahead of time and have them ready before you start mixing to reduce the chances of accidentally leaving something out.
4. Chill your cakes before frosting and filling. 
5. You can replace the Guinness in this recipe with another type of stout beer or room temperature water or coffee, but it will not have the same taste.

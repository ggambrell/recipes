DirectionsInstructions Checklist
Step 1
Preheat oven to 350°F. In a food processor, blitz Oreos until they resemble fine crumbs. Measure out 2 Tablespoons and set aside for the Topping. Combine remaining crumbs with melted butter and press evenly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform cake pan.

Step 2
In a stand mixer, beat together cream cheese, sugar, and sour cream until well combined, about 3 minutes. Scrape the bottom of the bowl with a spatula and beat for an additional minute. Add eggs one at a time, beating on medium-low. Add flour, vanilla, and salt; mix to combine, about 1 minute. Fold in Oreo pieces with spatula. Pour filling into springform pan. Wrap the bottom and sides of the pan with several layers of aluminum foil. Place pan in a larger roasting pan and fill roasting pan with water until it’s a little over halfway up the side of the cake pan.

Step 3
Bake for 1 hour; turn off oven and leave cheesecake in the oven for 30 minutes before removing. Unwrap aluminum foil from pan, run a knife around the edge of the cake, and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.

Step 4
Mix powdered sugar, sour cream, and salt until smooth. Add reserved 2 Tablespoons of Oreo crumbs from Step 1 and stir to combine. Remove cheesecake from springform pan; evenly spread Topping across the Cheesecake. Garnish with remaining broken Oreos.

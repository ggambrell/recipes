Serves:  

Ingedients:  
__Shells__
80 grams extra fine almond flour
85 grams powdered sugar
2 large egg whites (about 60-64 grams), room temperature
1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar
pinch salt
50 grams granulated sugar (about 1/4 cup)
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
food coloring

__Filling__
1/4 cup butter softened
3/4 cup powdered sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon milk

Directions:  
Shells
1. Sift the almond flour and powdered sugar together and set aside.
2. In the bowl of an electric mixer with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites on medium until foamy. 
3. Add in the cream of tartar and salt. Continue beating and add in about 1 tablespoon sugar at a time. 
4. Increase speed to med-high and mix until soft peaks. 
4b. (optional) At this point you can add the vanilla/flavoring and food coloring. 
5. Continue mixing until stiff peaks. 
6. Remove the bowl from the machine. Should be able to flip the mixture upside down and it will stay.

7. Sift the almond flour and powdered sugar again but into the bowl of the meringue. 
8. Using a rubber scraper, gently fold the ingredients together by scraping the sides and bottom, folding the meringue up onto the dry ingredients and pressing down. 
9. The batter will thin up as you mix. You are done once you are able to have the batter slowly drop back in the bowl making a figure 8. The batter will drop like molten lava and will dissolve back into the batter within ten seconds.

10. Spoon batter into a piping bag fitted with a A2 round piping tip. 
11. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper with templates underneath. Holding the bag vertical, gently squeeze the batter out until batter reaches the inside line of the circle on the template. Release pressure and lift the bag up with a quick circular motion and then move to the next circle and repeat.
12. Once all the batter is piped, slam the pan down on the counter a few times so that all the air bubbles are released. If you see some air bubbles at the top you and pop them with a toothpick. Let the batter dry for 45-60 minutes. The top should be "crispy."
13. About 10 minutes before drying time is up, preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. 
14. Bake for 20 minutes on the middle rack and then remove from oven and let cool on the pan for 5 minutes. 
15. Slide the parchment paper onto a cooling rack. 
16. Fill once completely cooled.

Filling (Flavoring depends on type of macaron):
1. Cream the butter, powdered, sugar, milk and vanilla together for 2-3 minutes until creamy. 
2. Remove beaters and stir with a rubber spatula for a couple minutes to get out air bubbles. 
3. Place in a piping bag and apply 1-2 teaspoons filling to the bottom of a shell. 
4. Place the bottom of a second shell on top and squish together with a little twist.

Notes: 
1. Weigh your ingredients! Using measuring cups is not very accurate since there is room for variations in how much one can pack into a measuring cup.
2. Use room temperature eggs. Room temperature eggs are easier to whip to create the meringue. You can set them out a few hours before making the cookies or place them in a bowl of warm water for 5 minutes.
3. Beat the egg whites and sugar just until they read stiff peaks. If you overbeat it will start to separate. If adding color or extract you need to add it at the soft peak stage so that it can mix all the way in before you reach stiff peak stage.
4. Use gel food coloring. Using liquid food coloring affects the dry to liquid ratio so gel is best.
5. Sift! You must sift the flour and sugar a total of 2 times each. This ensures you don’t have any clumps so that everything will mix evenly.
6. Fold, don’t stir. After you sift the ingredients on top of the meringue, use a rubber scraper to fold the meringue up from the bottom and sides of the bowl to on top of the dry ingredients. Keep repeating, turning the bowl as needed. The mixture will be thick at first but as you keep folding it will begin to thin.
7. Occasionally test the batter while folding to see if it drops from the spatula slowly like lava. You should be able to slowly drop it back into the bowl, forming a figure eight that disappears back into the rest of the batter in 10 seconds. Stop folding and then place in a piping bag with a round piping tip.
8. Tap the pan. Pretty forcefully, tap the pan on the counter to get any air bubbles to come to the top and pop. This will prevent your macarons from cracking when baking.
9. Be patient and let them dry. I live in a humid place (80-100% humidity) and I always let my macarons dry for 45-60 minutes. They are ready to put in the oven when you can touch the top of the batter and it is no longer wet or sticky.
10. Bake the macarons for 20 minutes and then let them cool on the pan 5 minutes before sliding the parchment onto a cooling rack. If you don’t bake your macarons long enough they will collapse and look wrinkly and be a little difficult to get off the parchment paper.
11. Let the cookie shells cool completely before applying filling.
12. Pipe on a little filling (1-2 teaspoons) and then twist another shell on top to help it stick together better.

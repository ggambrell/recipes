Directions: 
Spiced pumpkin pound cake
1. Line 9×5 loaf pan (or 8.5 X 4.5) with parchment paper, leaving 1-2 in. overhang on the sides.
2. Preheat oven to 350F (177C). Move an oven rack to the lower 1/3 of the oven (right under the middle rack level).
3. Whisk together flours, pumpkin spice, baking powder and salt. Set aside. 
4. In a stand mixer with paddle attachment, beat/cream butter on low for 1 minute. Increase to medium speed for 4-6 additional minutes, until butter is lighter and fluffier. If you're top to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.
5. Beat the butter with the sugar by slowly streaming in sugar. This whole step should take 1-2 minutes. Once all the sugar has been added, beat/cream the sugar and butter together for an additional minute. Sugar should be mostly dissolved into the butter at this point.
6. Slowly add eggs to the butter and sugar. Add one egg at a time, beating on low until it fully incorporates before adding the next. Beat in the vanilla etxract. Beat an addtional minute on low speed. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl.
7. Switch to a large spatula, or spoon. The next steps will be done by hand.
8. Fold in dry ingredients and pumpkin to the wet ingredients in this order: dry, pumpkin dry, pumpkin, dry.
9. Fold each part about 90% into the wet ingredients before adding the next. Fold all ingredients in the batter togther until smooth and well combined. 
10. Gently scoop the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Using a small offset spatula or spoon, level and smooth the batter into the corners and across the pan.
11. Bake at 350F (177C) for 60-70 minutes ( in the lower 1/3 of the oven). Check the top. It should be golden, but not burned. There should also be a large crack in the center of the cake. This is where the steam escapes and is perfect! 
12. Cool in pan for 20 minutes. Remove from pan and cool an addtional 50 minutes (1 hr total). Top with powdered sugar or the recommended salted maple caramel glaze.

Salted maple caramel glaze
1. In a small sauce pan, combine the butter, maple syrup, sugar, cream, and salt.
2. Bring the ingredients to a boil over medium high heat. Stir as frequently needed to ensure the ingredients are melting evenly and are well comibined.
3. Bring to a boil over medium high heat for 1 minute. Once boiling, start the time and stir constantly.
4. Remove from heat and cool for 1-2 minutes.
5. Pour the warm caramel sauce into a bowl with the powdered sugar. Pour in the vanilla extract. Whisk or stir until well combined with no lumps of sugar. Taste and add a pinch more salt if desired.
6. Pour the caramel glaze over the cooled pumpkin pound cake.
7. After 5 minutes, top the glaze with chopped nuts if desired. Allow 30-60 minutes for the glaze to fully set.

Notes:
1. Make the glaze after the pumpkin cake has had time to cool.
2. DIY cake flour: for 1 c (120-125g) cake flour, remove 2 tbsp (15g) all purpose flour from the 1 c all purpose flour. replace the 2 tbsp with an equal amount of corn starch. sift the new mixture together 3-4 times to fully blend together. (Since this recipe calls for 2/3c, you can follow the above mentioned method with some flour leftover or you can scoop 4 teaspoons of cornstarch into a measuring cup. add all purpose flour leveled to the top to make 2/3 c using the spoon and level method. sift together 3-4 times. follow the remainder of the recipe as written.)

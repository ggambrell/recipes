Serves: 12  

Ingedients:  
__Cake__
1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature 2 sticks
1/3 cup vegetable oil
2 1/2 cups granulated sugar
3 cups Cake flour, sifted
6 large eggs room temperature
2 large egg yolks room temperature
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons pure vanilla extract

__Caramel Icing__
1 1/2 sticks butter
2 cans evaporated milk 12 ounces each
2 cup granulated sugar
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

Directions:
Cake:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. In a large mixing bowl, cream butter, oil and sugar on high until fully incorporated and light and fluffy, about 5-6 minutes.
3. Turn mixer to medium speed and mix in eggs and egg yolks one at a time until well incorporated.
4. Add in vanilla extract and mix.
5. Sift cake flour, baking powder and salt into a medium sized bowl.
6. With mixer on slow speed, alternate adding in flour mixture and sour cream ending with flour mixture until mixed through. Be wary of over mixing.
7. Spray three 9 inch round cake pans with baking spray or grease and flour them.
8. Pour batter into individual cake pans evenly.
9. Bake in preheated oven for 23-30 minutes or until fully baked.
10. Remove cake pans from oven and cool on cooling racks for 10 minutes.
11. Remove cakes from pans and wait until completely cooled to ice.

Caramel Icing:
12. Add butter, evaporated milk, and sugar to saucepan over medium heat until everything has melted together.
13. Leave over medium to low heat stirring periodically for about 1 1/2- 2 hours (watch the entire time to make sure it does not burn until thickened and caramel has darkened to a beautiful golden brown. It should also thickly coat the back of a spoon to ensure thickness. Be wary of burning or over thickening.
14. Remove from heat and add in vanilla extract.
15. Cool for about 15-20 minutes to allow it to thicken before icing the cake. If you see that it is too warm and still not completely thick enough, cool it in the refrigerator and get it thick!
P.S. Some people like to take the caramel and whip it in a stand mixer to create more of a frosting texture. That is totally up to you.

Note:
1. Whip caramel in standard mixer to make fluffier like frosting.
2. Pipe caramel icing/frosting versus spreading.
3. Fill a caramel pool in between two cake layers.

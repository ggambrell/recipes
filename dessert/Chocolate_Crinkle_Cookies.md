Serves: 48 cookies  

Equipment:

Ingedients:  
2 1/3 cups (284g) all-purpose flour (spoon into measuring cup to measure)  
2 tsp baking powder  
1/2 tsp salt  
2 cups (400g) granulated sugar  
3/4 cup (175ml) vegetable oil  
1 cup (85g) unsweetened cocoa powder (spoon into measuring cup to measure)  
4 large eggs  
2 tsp vanilla extract  
3/4 cup (97g) powdered sugar  

Directions:  
1. In a medium mixing bowl whisk together flour, baking powder and salt, set aside.
2. In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, blend together granulated sugar and oil. 
3. Mix in cocoa powder and blend well. Beat in eggs and vanilla. 
4. Add in flour mixture and mix until blended. 
5. Cover dough and freeze for 45 - 60 minutes or refrigerate overnight (until it isn't too sticky to work with).
6. The following day preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone liners.
7. Place powdered sugar in a small mixing bowl. 
8. Remove about 1/4 of the dough from the refrigerator at a time to work with and let remaining chill. 
9.Scoop dough out and shape into balls about 1-inch each. 
10. Roll in powdered sugar then place on prepared baking sheet spacing them 2-inches apart. 
11. Bake in preheated oven 10 - 13 minutes until nearly set - they should be soft when touched and should appear slightly under-baked. 
12. Cool on baking sheet several minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool. 
13. Store cookies in an airtight container once they are nearly cool. Repeat process with remaining dough. 

Notes:  
1. For best results use a kitchen scale to measure ingredients if you have on, otherwise be sure to use the proper method as listed for measuring.
2. Donâ€™t skip the chilling, otherwise dough will be way too sticky and unmanageable to work with.
3. For less stickiness use freezing option. Also coating hands with non-stick cooking spray may be helpful if needed too.
4. Coat generously with powdered sugar for a beautiful contrast from the light and dark finish.
5. Remove cookies while they look just slightly under-baked. That way they are more fudgy and brownie-like.
6. If you want them to spread a little more you can press down on them slightly before baking then sprinkle over a little more powdered sugar if needed.

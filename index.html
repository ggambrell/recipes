      <p>Welcome! I am a normal guy who is interested in baking .... and sometimes cooking, but mostly baking. On this page you will find recipes that are not mine that I hope to try in the future. Links have been added to the original post where I found the recipe. I have copied the ingredients and steps in case the website links go bad. As I try the recipes I will make them my own and openly share them for all to enjoy. Happy baking!<p>

Serves: 4  

Equipment:

Ingedients:  
1 pound bulk Italian sausage  
1 can (15 ounces) pizza sauce, divided  
1-1/2 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese, divided  
4 ounces Canadian bacon, chopped  
2 tubes (8 ounces each) refrigerated crescent rolls  

Directions:  
Cook sausage in a large skillet over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Stir in 1/2 cup pizza sauce, 1 cup cheese and Canadian bacon.
Unroll crescent dough and separate into triangles. On an ungreased 14-in. pizza pan, arrange triangles in a ring with points toward the outside and wide ends overlapping at the center, leaving a 4-in. opening. Press overlapping dough to seal.
Spoon filling onto wide end of triangles. Fold pointed end of triangles over filling, tucking points under to form a ring (filling will be visible).
Bake at 375Â° for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown and heated through. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake 5 minutes longer or until cheese is melted. Serve with remaining pizza sauce.
